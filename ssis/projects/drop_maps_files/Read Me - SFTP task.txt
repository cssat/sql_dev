For people newly downloading this project, you will need to download and install the third-party SFTP task on your computer before you will be able to run it.
The SFTP task can be downloaded and installed using the instructions at http://ssissftp.codeplex.com/releases.
This package uses the SSIS SFTP v2.0.0.30 for SQL Server 2012 version. Hopefully this document will be updated as things change.
